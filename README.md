# Clinical Outcome Prediction System - README

## Overview
The Clinical Outcome Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution designed to assess a patient's health condition based on vital signs and demographic factors. The system predicts a health severity score (0-100%) and classifies patients into risk categories (Healthy, Mild Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk) to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and proactive care.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Prediction**: Provides instant health risk assessments based on patient vitals.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy input and visualization.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses Random Forest Regression for accurate predictions.
- **Scalability**: Designed for integration with EHR systems and IoT health devices.
- **Explainability**: Supports future enhancements like SHAP/LIME for model interpretability.

## System Requirements
### Hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD.
- **Recommended**: Intel Core i7/i9 / AMD Ryzen 7/9, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GPU (optional for deep learning).

### Software
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04+, or macOS 11+.
- **Python**: 3.8+ with libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `streamlit`, `joblib`.
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or PyCharm.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ClinicalOutcomePrediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit joblib
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Run the web application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Streamlit interface in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Enter patient vitals:
   - Heart Rate (bpm)
   - Blood Pressure (mmHg)
   - Respiratory Rate (breaths/min)
   - Oxygen Saturation (%)
   - Body Temperature (Â°C)
   - Glucose Level (mg/dL)
   - Age (years)
3. Click **"Calculate Health Score"** to view the predicted severity score and risk classification.

## Sample Test Cases
| Heart Rate | Blood Pressure | Respiratory Rate | Oxygen Saturation | Body Temp | Glucose | Age | Expected Output |
|------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| 70         | 110            | 16               | 100               | 37.1      | 90      | 25  | 26.4% (Healthy) |
| 110        | 145            | 21               | 90                | 39        | 180     | 40  | 45.25% (Mild Risk) |
| 130        | 180            | 30               | 83                | 40        | 250     | 70  | 87.5% (High Risk) |

## Output Screens
- **Home Screen**: Input form for patient vitals.
- **Results**: Displays severity score, risk classification, and progress bar.
- **Alerts**: Recommendations based on risk level (e.g., "Seek immediate medical help").

## Future Enhancements
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time data from wearable devices.
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM/CNN models for improved accuracy.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Scalable hosting on AWS/Google Cloud.
- **Mobile App**: Health monitoring on-the-go.
- **EHR Integration**: Seamless data exchange with hospital systems.

## Testing
The system has undergone:
- **Unit Testing**: Validated data preprocessing and model loading.
- **Integration Testing**: Verified UI-model communication.
- **Functional Testing**: Confirmed risk classification accuracy.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensured fast response times (<1 second).
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Feedback from healthcare professionals.
